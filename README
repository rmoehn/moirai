Moirai

With this program you can add a "shelf life" to files: When a file
hasn't been modified (mtime) for a specified time, it is deleted.

This is just a quick hack. I hope to have the time to make a proper
package of this, but that may as well be never. However, if you send me
and email and kindly ask for a package, I might create one in
relatively short time.
