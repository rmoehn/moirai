WARNING: This program works (for me), but part of its operation is
deleting files from disk. DELETING FILES FROM DISK! Don't use it unless
you know what you're doing.

With this program you can set a "shelf life" for files: When a file
hasn't been modified (mtime) for a specified time, it is deleted.

Klotho and Pieria
-----------------

With these two programs you can set the shelf lives of emails in a
maildir through Mutt. Actually their principle of working can be
generalised to work around a serious (to me) problem in Mutt: you
cannot execute an external command on the currently selected email.

One could also use Mutt-Guile to do that, but I am not sure of that
project's status. And after all: Who uses Mutt anymore?

Themis
------

This little scripts extracts the Date: fields from emails and adjusts
the mtimes accordingly. Maildir only, of course.

Note
----

This is just a quick hack. I hope to have the time to make a proper
package of this, but that may as well be never. However, if you send me
and email and kindly ask for a package, I might create one in
relatively short time.
